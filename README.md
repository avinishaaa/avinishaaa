## Projects 📦

### Breast Cancer Detection 🩺

  (October 2022 - August 2023)
- Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women in the world. However, the manual diagnosis of breast cancer imaging is a time-consuming and difficult task requiring considerable expertise. 
  This report aims to develop an automated method for detecting Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) using whole slide images. This research uses a dataset of about 5,547 50x50pixelsRGB digital images of 
  H&E-coloured breast histopathological samples labelled as IDC or non-IDC to create an automated system that helps doctors identify and classify breast cancers correctly (especially IDCs) to reduce 
  errors and save time. The research also uses various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and K-nearest Neighbors 
  to identify IDC in breast cancer histopathology images. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using various evaluation measures, including accuracy, precision, memory, F1 score, K-fold cross-validation, 
  and comparison with other related works. The main findings of our research show that the CNN algorithm, with a score of 0.78, accuracy has been the most successful in recognizing IDC. In addition, CNN instance 4 
  achieved an accuracy rate of 77.67%, a precision rate of 77.15%, a recall rate of 79.52 %, and an F1-score of 78.31 %.

### Heart Failure Prediction ❤️

(October 2020 - May 2021)

I undertook a project focused on creating and evaluating predictive models for heart failure prediction. This project spanned from October 2020 to May 2021 and involved extensive data analysis and machine-learning techniques.
The primary objective of the project was to develop models that could effectively predict the occurrence of heart failure based on a given dataset. To accomplish this, I utilized the WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge 
Analysis) software tool for data evaluation and analysis. I employed various supervised learning algorithms, such as cost function, gradient descent, and decision boundary, to train the models using the provided training dataset.
Throughout the project, I meticulously examined and preprocessed the data to ensure its quality and reliability. This included handling missing values, normalizing features, and addressing outliers or inconsistencies. 
By performing these data preprocessing steps, I aimed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the predictive models. Once the models were trained using the training dataset, I evaluated their performance on the 
testing dataset. This involved feeding the testing data into the trained models and assessing their ability to predict heart failure cases accurately. I leveraged the capabilities of WEKA to assess the models' predictive 
accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics. The project allowed me to gain a deep understanding of predictive modelling techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data evaluation methodologies. 
I honed my skills in feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation. Furthermore, I developed a strong proficiency in using the WEKA tool for data analysis and machine learning tasks. This project not only 
expanded my knowledge of heart failure prediction but also reinforced my passion

### UoBD Smart Academy 💡

(October 2021 - August 2022)
- I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project involving creating a full-stack web application. The project utilized technologies such as Django, Angular, and MongoDB to develop a robust and dynamic web application.
  As a project manager, I took on the responsibility of managing the team and ensuring smooth coordination among team members. I assigned specific roles to each team member based on their expertise and specialization, allowing 
  them to contribute effectively to the project. In terms of development, I actively participated in both backend and frontend development tasks. On the backend, I leveraged Django, a powerful Python framework, to design and 
  implement the server-side logic of the web application. This involved handling data models, implementing APIs, and integrating with the database. On the front end, I utilized Angular, a popular JavaScript framework, to create 
  an interactive and user-friendly interface. I implemented user authentication, data visualization, and seamless navigation, ensuring an engaging user experience. Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the team, 
  conducting regular meetings and ensuring effective communication. I facilitated knowledge-sharing and problem-solving sessions, fostering a collaborative and productive environment. Working on this full-stack web application 
  project enhanced my skills in web development, specifically in back-end development. I gained hands-on experience with technologies and frameworks widely used in the industry, equipping me with practical knowledge and insights.
  Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my proficiency in web development, particularly in back-end development. It gave me valuable experience in project management, teamwork, and technical execution, which are crucial in 
  delivering successful web applications.

### NearByMoms 🌟

(May 2019 - May 2020)

- At GEMS Education, I embarked on an exciting project called NearByMoms from May 2019 to May 2020. As part of this project, I took on the responsibility of creating a working prototype of a mobile application, focusing on the 
  development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). One of the key aspects of this project was the creation of a robust and efficient database. I worked diligently to design and implement the database, ensuring it could handle 
  real data and real people. This involved defining the schema, setting up tables, and establishing relationships between entities. By leveraging my database management skills, I ensured that the database could effectively 
  store and retrieve information, supporting the seamless functioning of the application. Throughout the year-long development process, I played a central role in managing the database and the application. 
  This encompassed monitoring the performance of the database, identifying and resolving any issues or bottlenecks, and ensuring the smooth operation of the application. Working on NearByMoms from scratch gave me valuable 
  experience in project management, software development, and database administration. It allowed me to gain insights into the entire software development lifecycle, from conceptualization and prototyping to deployment and 
  maintenance. By taking ownership of the project and seeing it through from start to finish, I honed my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and attention to detail. Overall, NearByMoms was an impactful project that 
  allowed me to apply my technical expertise and project management skills practically. It showcased my ability to create innovative solutions, work with real-world data, and manage the complexities of a long-term project.
